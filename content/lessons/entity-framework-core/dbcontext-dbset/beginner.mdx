# DbContext & DbSet in Entity Framework Core

Imagine you're at a fancy restaurant. You don't go into the kitchen to cook your food - instead, you have a **waiter** who takes your order, communicates with the kitchen, and brings you your meal. In Entity Framework Core, **DbContext** is exactly like that waiter - it's the bridge between your C# code and the database!

## What is DbContext?

DbContext is your **connection point** to the database. It's the main class that:

- Connects to your database
- Keeps track of all the changes you make
- Sends those changes to the database when you're ready

> **Think of it this way:**
>
> DbContext is like a universal translator - you speak C#, the database speaks SQL, and DbContext translates everything between you two!

## What is DbSet?

A DbSet represents a **collection of entities** of a specific type. If DbContext is the restaurant, then each DbSet is like a menu section - one for appetizers, one for main courses, one for desserts.

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Your First DbContext"
  code={`// This is your "waiter" - connects to database
public class BloggingContext : DbContext
{
    // These are "menu sections" - collections of data
    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }
}`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "Creating your context",
      explanation:
        "BloggingContext inherits from DbContext - this makes it your database bridge",
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [5],
      highlight: "Blog menu section",
      explanation: "DbSet<Blog> = a collection of all blogs in your database",
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [6],
      highlight: "Post menu section",
      explanation: "DbSet<Post> = a collection of all posts in your database",
    },
  ]}
/>

## The Magic of SaveChanges

Just like a waiter doesn't run to the kitchen after every word you say, DbContext **batches your requests**. You can add, modify, or delete many things, and they all get saved at once when you call `SaveChanges()`.

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Using DbContext"
  code={`// Create a new blog (like writing on a notepad)
var blog = new Blog { Title = "My Blog" };

// Tell the context about it
context.Blogs.Add(blog);

// Now send it to the database!
context.SaveChanges();`}
steps={[
{
lineNumbers: [2],
highlight: "Create your data",
explanation: "This just creates an object in memory - not in the database yet!"
},
{
lineNumbers: [5],
highlight: "Tell the context",
explanation: "Add() marks this blog as 'needs to be inserted'"
},
{
lineNumbers: [8],
highlight: "Save to database",
explanation: "SaveChanges() sends all pending changes to the database at once"
}
]}
/>

## Quick Summary

| Concept         | What It Does                     | Analogy                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **DbContext**   | Bridge between C# and database   | Restaurant waiter        |
| **DbSet**       | Collection of one type of entity | Menu section             |
| **SaveChanges** | Sends all changes to database    | Sending order to kitchen |
