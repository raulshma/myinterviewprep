# Querying Data with LINQ

Imagine you have a huge library with thousands of books. LINQ is like having a super-smart librarian who can find exactly what you need instantly! Instead of saying "find books," you can say "find all mystery books written after 2020 with more than 300 pages" - and LINQ gets them for you!

## What is LINQ?

**LINQ** (Language Integrated Query) lets you ask questions about your data using C# code. EF Core then translates your questions into SQL that the database understands.

> **Think of it this way:**
>
> You speak C#, the database speaks SQL, and LINQ is your translator that converts your requests perfectly!

## Your First Query

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Basic LINQ Query"
  code={`// Get all blogs
var allBlogs = context.Blogs.ToList();

// Get blogs with "Tech" in the title
var techBlogs = context.Blogs
.Where(b => b.Title.Contains("Tech"))
.ToList();

// Get just one blog by ID
var blog = context.Blogs.Find(1);`}
steps={[
{
lineNumbers: [2],
highlight: "Get everything",
explanation: "ToList() fetches all blogs from the database"
},
{
lineNumbers: [5, 6, 7],
highlight: "Filter with Where",
explanation: "Where() is like a sieve - only matching items get through"
},
{
lineNumbers: [10],
highlight: "Find by ID",
explanation: "Find() is a shortcut to get one item by its primary key"
}
]}
/>

## Common Query Operations

| What You Want   | LINQ Method         | Example                   |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------ |
| Filter items    | `.Where()`          | Only blogs with 5+ rating |
| Sort items      | `.OrderBy()`        | Sort by date              |
| Get first item  | `.FirstOrDefault()` | Get newest blog           |
| Count items     | `.Count()`          | How many posts?           |
| Check if exists | `.Any()`            | Are there any posts?      |

## Sorting Your Results

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Sorting with OrderBy"
  code={`// Sort A to Z by title
var sorted = context.Blogs
    .OrderBy(b => b.Title)
    .ToList();

// Sort newest first
var newest = context.Blogs
.OrderByDescending(b => b.CreatedDate)
.ToList();`}
steps={[
{
lineNumbers: [2, 3, 4],
highlight: "OrderBy",
explanation: "Sorts in ascending order (A→Z, 1→10)"
},
{
lineNumbers: [7, 8, 9],
highlight: "OrderByDescending",
explanation: "Sorts in descending order (Z→A, newest first)"
}
]}
/>

## Getting Just One Item

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Single Item Queries"
  code={`// Get first blog (or null if none exist)
var first = context.Blogs.FirstOrDefault();

// Get first blog matching condition
var techBlog = context.Blogs
.FirstOrDefault(b => b.Title.Contains("Tech"));

// Get single item (throws if more than one!)
var unique = context.Blogs
.SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 5);`}
steps={[
{
lineNumbers: [2],
highlight: "FirstOrDefault",
explanation: "Gets the first item, or null if nothing found"
},
{
lineNumbers: [9, 10],
highlight: "SingleOrDefault",
explanation: "Like First, but throws an error if there are multiple matches"
}
]}
/>

## Quick Summary

- **LINQ** = Asking questions about data in C#
- **Where()** = Filter (keep only matching items)
- **OrderBy()** = Sort results
- **ToList()** = Execute query and get results
- **FirstOrDefault()** = Get one item (or null)
