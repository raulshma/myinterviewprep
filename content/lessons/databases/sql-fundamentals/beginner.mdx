# SQL Fundamentals

Welcome to the world of databases! SQL (Structured Query Language) is the universal language for talking to databases. Let's learn how to speak it!

## 🗣️ What is SQL?

Imagine you have a giant filing cabinet with thousands of folders. SQL is like having a super-smart assistant who can:

- **Find** any document you describe
- **Add** new documents
- **Update** existing documents
- **Remove** documents you don't need

> **Think of it this way:** SQL is like ordering at a restaurant. You tell the database what you want, and it brings it to you!

## The Four Magic Words: CRUD

Every database operation falls into four categories, known as **CRUD**:

| Operation | SQL Command | What It Does | Restaurant Analogy |
|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| **C**reate | INSERT | Adds new data | Ordering new food |
| **R**ead | SELECT | Retrieves data | Looking at the menu |
| **U**pdate | UPDATE | Changes existing data | Modifying your order |
| **D**elete | DELETE | Removes data | Canceling an order |

## SELECT - Reading Data 📖

SELECT is the most common SQL command. It's how you ask questions about your data.

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Your First SELECT Query"
  code={`-- Get everything from the Users table
SELECT * FROM Users;

-- Get only names and emails
SELECT Name, Email FROM Users;`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "The asterisk (*)",
      explanation: "The * means 'give me ALL columns' - it's like saying 'show me everything!'"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [5],
      highlight: "Specific columns",
      explanation: "You can also ask for just the columns you need - like ordering only the items you want"
    }
  ]}
/>

## INSERT - Adding Data ➕

INSERT adds new records to your table - like putting a new card in a filing cabinet.

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Adding a New User"
  code={`INSERT INTO Users (Name, Email, Age)
VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@email.com', 28);`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [1],
      highlight: "Table and columns",
      explanation: "Tell the database which table and which columns you're filling"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "The values",
      explanation: "Provide the actual data - make sure the order matches the columns!"
    }
  ]}
/>

## UPDATE - Changing Data ✏️

UPDATE modifies existing records. Be careful - you can change many records at once!

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Updating a User's Email"
  code={`UPDATE Users
SET Email = 'alice.new@email.com'
WHERE Name = 'Alice';`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [1],
      highlight: "Which table",
      explanation: "Specify the table you want to update"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "What to change",
      explanation: "SET tells the database what new value(s) to use"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [3],
      highlight: "WHERE is crucial!",
      explanation: "Without WHERE, you'd update EVERY row! Always double-check your WHERE clause"
    }
  ]}
/>

## DELETE - Removing Data 🗑️

DELETE permanently removes records. Once gone, they're gone forever (without backups)!

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Deleting a User"
  code={`-- Delete a specific user
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE Name = 'Alice';

-- DANGER! This deletes EVERYONE!
-- DELETE FROM Users;`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [3],
      highlight: "WHERE saves you",
      explanation: "The WHERE clause ensures you only delete what you intend to delete"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [6],
      highlight: "Never do this!",
      explanation: "Without WHERE, you'd delete ALL data in the table - always use WHERE with DELETE"
    }
  ]}
/>

## 🔍 WHERE - Filtering Your Data

The WHERE clause is like a filter - it lets you specify exactly which rows you want to work with.

```sql
-- Find users over 25
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 25;

-- Find users named 'Bob'
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = 'Bob';

-- Combine conditions
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 25 AND Active = 1;
```

## Quick Summary

| Command | Purpose | Always Include? |
|:--------|:--------|:----------------|
| SELECT | Read data | Usually with WHERE |
| INSERT | Add new data | Column values |
| UPDATE | Change data | **Always use WHERE!** |
| DELETE | Remove data | **Always use WHERE!** |
