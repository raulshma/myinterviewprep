# Service Communication

When microservices need to talk to each other, how do they do it? Just like people, services can communicate in different ways!

## Section 1: Sync vs Async Communication

<ServiceCommunicationDemo mode="beginner" />

Think about how you communicate with friends:

| **Phone Call (Synchronous)** | **Email (Asynchronous)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| You call and **wait** for them to answer | You send and **continue your day** |
| Both people engaged at the same time | Reply comes when they're ready |
| Know the answer immediately | No rush, response can take time |
| Can't do much else while calling | Free to do other things |

<InfoBox type="tip">
  **Synchronous** = You wait for an answer (like a phone call)  
  **Asynchronous** = You don't wait (like an email)
</InfoBox>

## Section 2: Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication (Phone Call)

When Service A calls Service B and **waits for a response**:

```
Order Service                    Payment Service
    │                                  │
    │──── "Process payment $50" ──────►│
    │         (waiting...)             │
    │◄──── "Payment successful!" ──────│
    │                                  │
```

**Used for:**
- Getting user profiles
- Checking product availability
- Validating data immediately

**The risk:**
- If Payment Service is slow, Order Service is slow
- If Payment Service is down, Order Service can't work

### Asynchronous Communication (Email)

Service A sends a message and **continues working**:

```
Order Service                Message Queue              Payment Service
    │                            │                           │
    │── "New order!" ───────────►│                           │
    │   (continues working)      │                           │
    │                            │── "New order!" ──────────►│
    │                            │                           │
    │                            │                    (processes later)
```

**Used for:**
- Sending notifications
- Processing background jobs
- Tasks that can happen later

**Benefits:**
- Order Service never waits
- If Payment is busy, messages wait in queue
- Services are more resilient

## Section 3: Choosing the Right Pattern

### Real-World Example: Pizza Order

| Step | Type | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Check if pizza available | **Sync** | Need answer NOW before ordering |
| Place the order | **Sync** | Need confirmation |
| Send receipt email | **Async** | Can happen in background |
| Notify delivery driver | **Async** | No rush, driver will see it |

### Key Takeaways

- **Synchronous** = Wait for response (HTTP calls)
- **Asynchronous** = Send and continue (Message queues)
- **Sync is simpler** but creates dependencies
- **Async is resilient** but more complex
- **Choose based on the situation!**
