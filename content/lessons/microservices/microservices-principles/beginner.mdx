# Microservices Principles

Imagine you're planning a city. Would you put everything—homes, shops, hospitals, schools—in one giant skyscraper? 🏢 Or would you create specialized neighborhoods where each area does its job best? **That's the difference between monoliths and microservices!**

## The City Planning Analogy 🏙️

Think of building software like city planning:

| **Monolith** 🏢 | **Microservices** 🏘️ |
| :--- | :--- |
| One massive building | Specialized neighborhoods |
| If elevator breaks, everyone stuck | One area can close for repairs |
| One landlord controls everything | Each neighborhood self-governed |
| Renovating affects everyone | Upgrade one area independently |

  **Microservices = Many small, independent services** that work together like a well-planned city!

## Core Principles (The Simple Version)

### 1. 🎯 Single Purpose
Each microservice does **one thing well**. Like a bakery that only makes bread, not also repairs cars!

### 2. 🏠 Independence
Services can be updated, deployed, and scaled **on their own**. The bakery can expand without affecting the bookstore next door.

### 3. 📦 Own Your Data
Each service has its **own database**. The bakery doesn't share its recipe book with the pizza shop!

## When to Use Microservices

<InfoBox type="warning">
  Microservices add complexity! Start simple (monolith) and split later when needed.
</InfoBox>

**Good for:**
- Large teams working on different features
- Parts of your app that need different scaling
- Different parts needing different technologies

**Maybe too much for:**
- Small projects or teams
- Startups finding product-market fit
- When you're just starting out

## Key Takeaways

- 🏘️ **Microservices = city of specialized neighborhoods**
- 🎯 Each service has **one job** (Single Responsibility)
- 🔒 Each service **owns its data** (No shared databases)
- 🚀 Services can be **deployed independently**
- ⚠️ **Start with a monolith** unless you have a good reason not to
