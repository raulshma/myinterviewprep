# Microservices Principles

Imagine you're planning a city. Would you put everything in one giant skyscraper? Or would you create specialized neighborhoods where each area does its job best? **That's the difference between monoliths and microservices!**

## Section 1: What Are Microservices?

### The City Planning Analogy

Think of building software like city planning:

| **Monolith** | **Microservices** |
| :--- | :--- |
| One massive building | Specialized neighborhoods |
| If elevator breaks, everyone stuck | One area can close for repairs |
| One landlord controls everything | Each neighborhood self-governed |
| Renovating affects everyone | Upgrade one area independently |

<InfoBox type="tip">
  **Microservices = Many small, independent services** that work together like a well-planned city!
</InfoBox>

## Section 2: Core Principles

### 1. Single Purpose
Each microservice does **one thing well**. Like a bakery that only makes bread, not also repairs cars!

### 2. Independence
Services can be updated, deployed, and scaled **on their own**. The bakery can expand without affecting the bookstore next door.

### 3. Own Your Data
Each service has its **own database**. The bakery doesn't share its recipe book with the pizza shop!

| Principle | What It Means | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Single Purpose | One job per service | UserService only handles users |
| Independence | Deploy separately | Update payments without touching orders |
| Data Ownership | Own database | Each service has its own DB |

## Section 3: When to Use Microservices

<InfoBox type="warning">
  Microservices add complexity! Start simple (monolith) and split later when needed.
</InfoBox>

### Good for:
- Large teams working on different features
- Parts of your app that need different scaling
- Different parts needing different technologies

### Maybe too much for:
- Small projects or teams
- Startups finding product-market fit
- When you're just starting out

### Key Takeaways

- Microservices = city of specialized neighborhoods
- Each service has **one job** (Single Responsibility)
- Each service **owns its data** (No shared databases)
- Services can be **deployed independently**
- **Start with a monolith** unless you have a good reason not to
