# Understanding Relational Database Architecture

Let's dive deeper into how relational databases work under the hood.

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

A **DBMS** is the software that manages the database. Popular ones include:

| DBMS       | Type        | Best For                     |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL | Open Source | Complex queries, extensions  |
| MySQL      | Open Source | Web applications, speed      |
| SQL Server | Commercial  | Enterprise, .NET integration |
| Oracle     | Commercial  | Large enterprises            |
| SQLite     | Embedded    | Mobile apps, local storage   |

## The Relational Model

The relational model was invented by **Edgar F. Codd** at IBM in 1970. It's based on mathematical set theory.

### Core Principles

1. **Data is stored in tables (relations)**
2. **Each table has a primary key** - unique identifier for each row
3. **Tables connect via foreign keys** - references to other tables
4. **Data is queried using SQL** - Structured Query Language

## Schema Design Basics

A **schema** is the structure of your database - the blueprint that defines:

- Tables and their names
- Columns and their data types
- Relationships between tables
- Constraints (rules for data integrity)

```sql
-- Example schema for a simple blog
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Posts (
    PostID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(200),
    Content TEXT,
    AuthorID INT REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);
```

## Keys Are Everything

| Key Type          | Purpose                      | Example              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Primary Key**   | Uniquely identifies each row | UserID               |
| **Foreign Key**   | Links to another table       | AuthorID → UserID    |
| **Composite Key** | Multiple columns as key      | (OrderID, ProductID) |
| **Natural Key**   | Real-world identifier        | ISBN, SSN            |
| **Surrogate Key** | System-generated ID          | Auto-increment ID    |

## Data Integrity Rules

RDBMS enforce **integrity constraints**:

- **Entity Integrity**: Primary keys can't be NULL
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys must exist in parent table
- **Domain Integrity**: Values must match column data type
- **User-Defined**: Custom business rules (CHECK constraints)

## The ACID Properties

Databases guarantee **ACID** for transactions:

| Property        | Meaning                      | Example                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Atomicity**   | All or nothing               | Transfer money: both debit AND credit  |
| **Consistency** | Data stays valid             | Can't have negative balance            |
| **Isolation**   | Transactions don't interfere | Two transfers don't corrupt each other |
| **Durability**  | Changes persist              | Data survives server restart           |
