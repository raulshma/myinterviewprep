# RIGHT JOIN: Practical Usage

When and how to effectively use RIGHT JOIN.

## Converting RIGHT to LEFT

```sql
-- Original with RIGHT JOIN
SELECT a.col1, b.col2, c.col3
FROM table_a a
INNER JOIN table_b b ON a.id = b.a_id
RIGHT JOIN table_c c ON b.id = c.b_id;

-- Equivalent with LEFT JOIN (rearranged)
SELECT a.col1, b.col2, c.col3
FROM table_c c
LEFT JOIN table_b b ON c.b_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN table_a a ON b.a_id = a.id;
```

## RIGHT JOIN in Complex Queries

```sql
-- When RIGHT JOIN makes sense
SELECT
    d.department_name,
    e.employee_name,
    p.project_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN projects p ON e.id = p.lead_id
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Shows all departments, even those with no project leads
```

## Finding Orphan Records

```sql
-- Orders referencing deleted customers
SELECT o.*
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.id IS NULL;

-- Data integrity check
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orphan_orders
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.id IS NULL;
```

## Mixed JOIN Types

```sql
SELECT
    c.name,
    o.id AS order_id,
    p.name AS product
FROM categories cat
INNER JOIN products p ON cat.id = p.category_id
RIGHT JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;
```

## Anti-Pattern: Excessive RIGHT JOINs

```sql
-- Hard to read:
SELECT * FROM a RIGHT JOIN b ON ... RIGHT JOIN c ON ... RIGHT JOIN d ON ...

-- Better: Use LEFT JOINs with logical table order
SELECT * FROM d LEFT JOIN c ON ... LEFT JOIN b ON ... LEFT JOIN a ON ...
```
