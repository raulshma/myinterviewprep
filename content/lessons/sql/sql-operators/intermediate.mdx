# SQL Operators: Complete Guide

Master all SQL operators for building sophisticated query conditions.

## Comparison Operators Deep Dive

### Standard Comparisons

```sql
-- Equal (be careful with NULL!)
WHERE status = 'active'

-- Not equal (two syntaxes)
WHERE status <> 'deleted'
WHERE status != 'deleted'

-- Range comparisons
WHERE price >= 10 AND price <= 100
-- Equivalent to:
WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 100
```

### NULL-Safe Comparisons

```sql
-- Regular comparison fails with NULL
WHERE column = NULL      -- Always FALSE (don't do this!)

-- Correct NULL checks
WHERE column IS NULL
WHERE column IS NOT NULL

-- NULL-safe equality (varies by database)
WHERE column <=> value   -- MySQL
WHERE column IS NOT DISTINCT FROM value  -- PostgreSQL/SQL Server
```

## String Operators

### LIKE Patterns

| Pattern  | Matches          | Example                      |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `%`      | Any characters   | `'%son'` → Anderson, Jackson |
| `_`      | Single character | `'_ohn'` → John, Bohn        |
| `[abc]`  | Any in brackets  | `'[JK]ohn'` → John, Kohn     |
| `[^abc]` | NOT in brackets  | `'[^J]ohn'` → Kohn, not John |

```sql
-- Case-insensitive search
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%smith%'

-- Escape special characters
WHERE description LIKE '%50\%%' ESCAPE '\'  -- Contains "50%"
```

### String Concatenation

```sql
-- Standard (SQL Server/PostgreSQL)
SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name AS full_name

-- PostgreSQL/Oracle
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name

-- CONCAT function (all databases)
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
```

## Logical Operator Precedence

Order of evaluation (highest to lowest):

1. `NOT`
2. `AND`
3. `OR`

```sql
-- This query...
WHERE a = 1 OR b = 2 AND c = 3
-- Is evaluated as...
WHERE a = 1 OR (b = 2 AND c = 3)

-- Use parentheses for clarity!
WHERE (a = 1 OR b = 2) AND c = 3
```

## Set Operators

### IN and NOT IN

```sql
-- IN is cleaner than multiple ORs
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped')

-- Subquery with IN
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM vip_customers
)

-- Watch out for NULL in NOT IN!
WHERE id NOT IN (1, 2, NULL)  -- Returns NO rows!
```

### EXISTS vs IN

```sql
-- EXISTS (often better for large subqueries)
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = customers.id
)

-- IN (simpler syntax)
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT id FROM vip_customers)
```

## Arithmetic Operations

```sql
SELECT
    quantity * price AS subtotal,
    quantity * price * 0.1 AS tax,
    quantity * price * 1.1 AS total,
    (end_date - start_date) AS days_between,  -- Date arithmetic
    salary / 12.0 AS monthly_salary  -- Use .0 to avoid integer division
FROM orders;
```

## Bitwise Operators

```sql
-- Permissions using bits
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE permissions & 4 = 4;  -- Has read permission (bit 2)

-- Operators
& -- AND
| -- OR
^ -- XOR
~ -- NOT
```
