# Response Formatting

When you order food at a restaurant, you expect it to be served properly - on a plate, not thrown at you! Similarly, your API needs to format responses correctly. **Response formatting** is how your API presents data back to clients.

## What is Response Formatting? 📤

Response formatting is how your API sends data back. This includes:

- **What format** (JSON, XML, plain text)
- **What status code** (success, error, not found)
- **What structure** (the shape of your data)

## The Menu Translation Analogy 🌍

> **Imagine you're at an international restaurant.**
>
> You can ask for the menu in English, Spanish, or French. The content is the same - but the format changes based on what you asked for. APIs work the same way with JSON, XML, etc!

## Status Codes = Responses

Think of status codes as the waiter's facial expressions:

| Code    | Meaning         | Real Life                               |
| :------ | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **200** | ✅ OK           | "Here's your order!"                    |
| **201** | ✅ Created      | "Your reservation is made!"             |
| **400** | ❌ Bad Request  | "Sorry, we don't understand your order" |
| **404** | 🔍 Not Found    | "We don't have that dish"               |
| **500** | 💥 Server Error | "Kitchen is on fire!"                   |

## Simple Response Example

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public ActionResult<Product> GetProduct(int id)
{
    var product = _service.GetById(id);

    if (product == null)
        return NotFound();  // 404 - "We don't have that!"

    return Ok(product);     // 200 - "Here it is!" + JSON data
}
```

## JSON = The Universal Language

By default, ASP.NET Core returns **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation):

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Laptop Pro",
  "price": 1299.99
}
```

**Why JSON?** It's lightweight, readable, and understood by every programming language!

| Concept          | Description                         |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Status Code**  | Number telling if request succeeded |
| **JSON**         | Default response format             |
| **Ok()**         | Returns 200 with data               |
| **NotFound()**   | Returns 404                         |
| **BadRequest()** | Returns 400                         |
