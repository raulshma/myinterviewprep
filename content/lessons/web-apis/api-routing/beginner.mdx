# Routing & Attributes

Think of your API like a city map. When someone wants to visit a specific shop (endpoint), they need the right address (route). In ASP.NET Core, **routing** tells your app which controller and action should handle each request!

## What is Routing? 🗺️

**Routing** is how ASP.NET Core matches incoming URLs to your controller actions. It's like a GPS system for your API!

## The GPS Analogy 🚗

> **Routes are like addresses. When someone requests `/api/products/42`, the routing system finds the right controller and says "Hey, someone wants product #42!"**

| URL Part    | What It Means                    |
| :---------- | :------------------------------- |
| `/api`      | The neighborhood (API area)      |
| `/products` | The street (controller)          |
| `/42`       | The house number (specific item) |

## Route Attributes 🏷️

You put attributes on your controller and actions to define routes:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]  // 👈 Base address for all actions
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]           // GET /api/products
    public string GetAll() => "All products!";

    [HttpGet("{id}")]   // GET /api/products/42
    public string GetById(int id) => $"Product {id}!";

    [HttpPost]          // POST /api/products
    public string Create() => "Created!";
}
```

## HTTP Methods = Types of Visits 🚪

| Method     | Meaning      | Example               |
| :--------- | :----------- | :-------------------- |
| **GET**    | "Show me"    | View a product        |
| **POST**   | "Create new" | Add a product         |
| **PUT**    | "Replace"    | Update entire product |
| **DELETE** | "Remove"     | Delete a product      |

## Route Parameters

The `{id}` in `[HttpGet("{id}")]` is a **route parameter**. It captures part of the URL:

```csharp
// URL: /api/products/42
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public string GetById(int id)  // id will be 42!
{
    return $"You asked for product {id}";
}
```

## Key Takeaways

| Concept          | Description                        |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **[Route]**      | Defines the URL pattern            |
| **[HttpGet]**    | Handles GET requests               |
| **{parameter}**  | Captures URL values                |
| **[controller]** | Auto-replaces with controller name |
