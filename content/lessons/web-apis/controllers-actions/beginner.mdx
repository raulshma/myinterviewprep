# Controllers & Actions

Imagine walking into a restaurant. You don't go straight to the kitchen, right? Instead, a **waiter** greets you, takes your order, and brings back your food. In ASP.NET Core Web APIs, **controllers** are like those waiters, and **actions** are what they do for you!

## What is a Controller? 🎯

A **controller** is a special class that handles incoming HTTP requests. Think of it as the traffic director of your API - it receives requests from the outside world and decides what to do with them.

## Understanding Actions 🎬

**Actions** are methods inside your controller. Each action handles a specific type of request:

| Action      | Real-World Comparison                            |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **GetAll**  | "Show me the menu" - Gets all items              |
| **GetById** | "Tell me about dish #5" - Gets one specific item |
| **Create**  | "I'd like to order this" - Creates something new |
| **Update**  | "Actually, make it spicy" - Changes something    |
| **Delete**  | "Cancel that order" - Removes something          |

## The Restaurant Analogy 🍽️

> **Controllers are waiters. Actions are what they do.**
>
> When you ask for the menu (GET request), the waiter (controller) performs the action of bringing you the menu. When you place an order (POST request), they perform the action of sending it to the kitchen.

## Key Takeaways

| Concept         | What It Is                                   |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Controller**  | A class that handles related requests        |
| **Action**      | A method inside the controller               |
| **Route**       | The URL path that triggers an action         |
| **HTTP Method** | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE - what type of action |

## Your First Controller

```csharp
// ProductsController.cs
[ApiController]  // "I'm an API controller!"
[Route("api/products")]  // "Find me at /api/products"
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    // This action runs for GET /api/products
    [HttpGet]
    public string GetAll()
    {
        return "Here are all the products!";
    }
}
```

**That's it!** With just a few lines, you've created an API endpoint that responds to requests.
