# Built-in Middleware: Your Ready-Made Toolkit 🧰

Imagine you want to build a house. Would you forge your own nails? Craft your own screws? Of course not! You'd use **ready-made tools**.

ASP.NET Core comes with a **toolbox full of middleware** for common tasks. Let's explore what's available!

## The Toolbox Analogy

| **Tool**                     | **What It Does**                    |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| 🔴 Exception Handler         | Catches errors and shows nice pages |
| 🔒 HTTPS Redirection         | Forces secure connections           |
| 📁 Static Files              | Serves CSS, JS, images              |
| 🛤️ Routing                   | Finds the right endpoint            |
| 👤 Authentication            | Checks who you are                  |
| 🔑 Authorization             | Checks what you can do              |

  **Don't reinvent the wheel!** ASP.NET Core has middleware for most common tasks. Use them instead of writing your own.

## The Essential Five

Every ASP.NET Core app typically uses these five:

### 1. 🔴 Exception Handler
**Catches errors so users see a friendly page, not scary code:**

```csharp
app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
```

### 2. 🔒 HTTPS Redirection
**Automatically upgrades HTTP to HTTPS:**

```csharp
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
```

### 3. 📁 Static Files
**Serves your CSS, JavaScript, and images from wwwroot:**

```csharp
app.UseStaticFiles();
```

### 4. 🛤️ Routing
**Figures out which endpoint to call based on the URL:**

```csharp
app.UseRouting();
```

### 5. 👤🔑 Authentication & Authorization
**Checks who you are and what you can do:**

```csharp
app.UseAuthentication();  // Who are you?
app.UseAuthorization();   // What can you do?
```

## A Simple Setup

Here's what a basic app looks like:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Use the built-in middleware!
app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthorization();

// Your endpoint
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

  **Notice:** Each middleware is just ONE line! ASP.NET Core does all the hard work for you.
</InfoBox>

## Key Takeaways

- 🧰 **Use what's built-in** — Don't write your own error handler or static file server
- 🔒 **Always use HTTPS** — It's 2024, security is non-negotiable
- 📋 **Order matters** — Exception Handler first, Authorization before your endpoints
- 🎯 **One line, one job** — Each `app.Use*()` adds one capability
